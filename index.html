    <div class="container">
<h1>FlexBox<h1>
    <h2>display:flex</h2>
    <p>Using display:flex in a container will cause every child in that container to adhere to the container's flex rules</p>
    <h2>Here are some examples:</h2>
    <div class="Blocks">
        <div class="Block1">1</div>
        <div class="Block1">2</div>

    </div>
    <p>In the above example the two blocks were put in a container named "Blocks" in this container using css 
        display:flex was specified this caused the blocks to be placed next to each other instead of below
    </p>
    <h2>Flex Spacing</h2>
    <p>You can also set the spacing between flex children</p>
    <div class="Blocks2">
    <div class="Block2">1</div>
    <div class="Block2">2</div>
    </div>
    <p>justify-content:space-between;</p>
    <div class="Blocks3">
        <div class="Block3">1</div>
        <div class="Block3">2</div>
        </div>
        <p>Space-Evenly</p>
        <div class="Blocks4">
            <div class="Block4">1</div>
            <div class="Block4">2</div>
            </div>
            <p>You can center elements too with flexbox how neat!</p>
            <p>There are others too like flex-end and flex-start as well flexbox is flexible.</p>
            <h2>Flex-Direction</h2>
            <p>By default the flex-direction is set to row (as seen above) however you can change it as you see fit</p>
                <div class="Blocks5">
                    <div class="Block5">1</div>
                    <div class="Block5">2</div>
                    </div>
                    <p>by using flex-direction: column we're able to reverse this now the elements are ontop of eachother!</p>
                    <div class="Blocks7">
                        <div class="Block7">1</div>
                        <div class="Block7">2</div>
                        </div>
                        <p>You can even reverse the order using flex-direction: row-reverse.
                   <div class="Rectangle">
                   <div class="Fill"></div>
                    <div class="Fill"></div>

                   </div>
                    <p>Using align-items:stretch in our container and flex-grow: in our child div we're able to make flex elements stretch to the full size of their respective divs
                </div>
